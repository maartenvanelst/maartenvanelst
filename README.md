### Hi there, I'm @maartenvanelst ðŸ‘‹
Just some student trying to figure out what to do next

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master's internship at UMC Utrecht
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning neural networks/PyTorch
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about bioinformatics, biology, and music too!

I like to spend some of my time working for and learning cool things at [BioLib Technologies](https://biolib.com/), be sure to check them out!
